// tools/ was built for — see CLAUDE.md's dev loop). Ported from Faves'
// js/sw-update.js verbatim (ADR 2026-08-08-0452 carries Faves' service
// worker pattern over; this is the update-flow half of it, not the
// precache split, which lives in sw.js itself).
//
// The problem these rules solve: a standalone PWA resumed from memory
// performs no navigation, so the browser never re-fetches sw.js and the
// app can sit on a stale shell until it is killed and relaunched — a bad
// look for an app whose whole pitch is "trust the shell that's on your
// phone". So the app checks on resume instead — but a phone flicking
// between apps fires those events constantly, so the check is throttled.
